# playit — UDP Tunnel Agent Service

Companion service in the Palworld template. Runs the official
[`ghcr.io/playit-cloud/playit-agent`](https://github.com/playit-cloud/playit-agent)
image (pinned `1.0.8`) as a **direct image source** — same pattern as Railway's
own minecraft-bedrock-server template. No Dockerfile: the upstream image is
deployed as-is with one variable.

## Why this service exists

Railway's public network is TCP/HTTP only — Palworld's game traffic (UDP :8211)
cannot be exposed directly. The playit agent makes **outbound** connections to
playit.gg's edge and tunnels player UDP traffic back over Railway's private
network to `palworld.railway.internal:8211`.

## Variable

`SECRET_KEY` — the agent secret from your playit.gg account (required).

The upstream entrypoint runs: `playitd --secret $SECRET_KEY --platform-docker`.
Until a valid key is set, the agent exits with an auth error and restarts
(non-fatal to the palworld service).

## Post-deploy setup (manual, in playit.gg dashboard)

1. Create a free account at https://playit.gg
2. Account → Agents → **Add Agent** → copy the **secret key**
3. In Railway, set `SECRET_KEY` on the `playit` service
4. In playit.gg → Tunnels → **Add Tunnel**:
   - Type: **UDP**
   - Local address: `palworld.railway.internal`
   - Local port: `8211`
5. Give players the allocation address playit.gg assigns

The tunnel target must point at the palworld service's private hostname —
cross-service private networking works automatically within the same Railway
project.
